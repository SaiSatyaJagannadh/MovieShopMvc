Partial Views 

steps for creation 

Coming to the views in mvc go to shared folder and create the default one for html view


for setting up everything for the new web page after clicking
http://localhost:5198/Movies/Details/Avatar

1. Creating movie control model controller when clicking on images of the thing 
-- click on scafffolding item --> MVC Controller Empty in the controller folder 
2.create Model in Models of Application Core like for property defination "MovieDetailsModel.cs"
3. In ImovieServices of app core or other Interface need to be created for deerving this in MovieService class of Infras
 like this     "MovieDetailsModel GetMovieDetails(int id);"
4. Implement the method in MovieService class of infrastr we added in IMovieServices interface.
--- we implemented the code in Interfaced linked to MovieService because we are using it in the MovieController
like this public MovieDetailsModel GetMovieDetails(int id)
              {
                  var movie = _movieRepository.GetById(id);
                  var m = new MovieDetailsModel()
                  {
                      Id = movie.Id,
                      Title = movie.Title,
                      PosterURL = movie.PosterUrl,
                      Budget = movie.Budget,
                      Overview = movie.Overview,
                      Revenue = movie.Revenue,
                      Tagline = movie.Tagline,
                  };
                  return m;
          
              }
5. After that we are going into http://localhost:5198/Movies/Details/Avatar details method in movie controller 
public ActionResult MovieDetails(int id)
        {
            var movie = _movieService.GetMovieDetails(id);
            return View(movie);
        }
6. Create the View for the Movies page -- create the folder under views of MVC and add --> Razor MVC View--> for html page 

7. Need to check the html redirecting it to the after clicking the image to do that
we already done this (Coming to the views in mvc go to shared folder and create the default one for html view)
we need to setup above one with "asp-action="MovieDetails" of html page we created
